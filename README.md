## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaratFa/online-store-free.git
   cd online-store-free
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To serve the production build:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start the production server on port 3000 (or the port specified in the PORT environment variable).

## 📖 Usage

### Browsing Products

- Navigate to the Products page to view all available items
- Use the search bar to find specific products
- Filter products by category using the category buttons
- Sort products by price or featured status

### Product Information

Each product card displays:
- Product image
- Product name
- Category
- Rating and number of reviews
- Original price (if discounted)
- Discounted price (if applicable)
- "Add to Cart" button

### Shopping Cart

- View your cart by clicking the cart icon in the header
- Adjust quantities using the + and - buttons
- Remove items with the trash icon
- View order summary with subtotal, tax, and total
- Proceed to checkout when ready

### User Account

- Create an account or log in through the Account page
- Access your dashboard after logging in
- View order history and saved information

### Component Architecture

The application follows a modular component structure:

- **Layout Components**: Header and Footer for consistent page structure
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements like Button and Input
- **Product Components**: Product-specific components like ProductCard

All components are organized in their respective directories with index files for clean imports.

## 🔄 API Fallback Mechanism

The application includes a robust API fallback system that ensures smooth operation even when the backend is unavailable:

- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects when the backend is not responding
- **Seamless Transition**: Switches to mock data without user interruption
- **Development Mode**: Uses mock data by default in development for faster development
- **Type Safety**: All mock data is properly typed to match the real API responses
- **Consistent Interface**: The same API interface is used regardless of whether real or mock data is being used

### How It Works

1. When the application starts, it tries to connect to the backend API
2. If any request fails (connection refused), the response interceptor:
   - Logs a warning message
   - Switches to mock API mode
   - Returns appropriate mock data based on the request URL and method
3. Once switched to mock mode, all subsequent requests use mock data

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Products

To add new products:

1. Open `src/data.ts`
2. Add a new product object to the `products` array with the following structure:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number,              // Unique identifier
     name: string,            // Product name
     description: string,     // Product description
     price: number,           // Regular price
     discountPrice?: number,  // Optional discounted price
     image: string,           // Image path
     category: string,        // Product category
     stock: number,           // Available stock
     rating: number,          // Average rating (1-5)
     reviews: number          // Number of reviews
   }
   ```

3. Add the product image to the `public/images` directory

### Adding New Categories

To add new product categories:

1. Open `src/data.ts`
2. Add the new category to the `categories` array:
   ```typescript
   export const categories = [
     "All",
     "Electronics",
     "Clothing",
     // Add your new category here
   ];
   ```

### Creating New Components

To add new components:

1. Create the component file in the appropriate directory:
   - Layout components: `src/components/layout/`
   - UI components: `src/components/ui/`
   - Product components: `src/components/product/`

2. Create the component with TypeScript:
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   import './ComponentName.css';

   export const ComponentName: React.FC = () => {
     return (
       <div className="component-name">
         {/* Component content */}
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

3. Create the corresponding CSS file

4. Export the component in the directory's index.ts file

### Styling

The application uses CSS with custom properties for consistent theming:

- Primary colors are defined in `index.css`
- Component-specific styles are in separate CSS files
- Responsive design uses media queries

### Adding New Pages

To add new pages:

1. Create a new component in `src/pages/`
2. Add a route in `App.tsx`
3. Add navigation links in `Header.tsx` if needed
